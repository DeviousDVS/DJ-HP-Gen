<div class="instruct" id="data" onclick="getAnimals()"><p>1. Determine Socio-Economic Class (SEC)<br>
  ...and select a vocation from those with the appropriate range of Class Level. Then note Vocation SEC if it differs from the basic, Family, SEC of the HP. Information on SEC begins on page 58.</p></div>

<div class="instruct"><p>2. Select a starting Age<br>
  ...as ATTRIBUTE, CATEGORY, &amp; TRAIT (ACT) totals, STEEP, and Wealth are affected by Age category. Information regarding HP Age is found on page 104.</p></div>

<div class="instruct"><p>3. Determine Birth Rank<br>
  ...as first children may have inherited Wealth, and 7th children can have all manner of additional factors added to their make up. Information on Birth Rank is found on pages 102-103.</p></div>

<div class="instruct"><p>4. Determine any Quirks and/or Counter-Quirks<br>
  ...as such can also have impact on the Heroic Persona's make-up. Information on this subject is found on pages 106-108 and also on page 111.</p></div>

<div class="instruct"><p>5. Generate statistics<br>
  ...and assign them to the HP's Mental, Physical, and Spiritual TRAITS, CATEGORIES, and ATTRIBUTES. Remember to adjust the numbers rolled by any Age, Birth Rank, and/or Quirks/Counter-Quirks factors. The resulting scores are then used to determine the persona's Damage and Effect Levels. Information on HP Statistics begins on page 64.</div>

<div>6. Calculate STEEP for the Knowledge/Skill Areas.</div>
<div>In addition to five "universal" K/S Areas, each persona will possess a standard set of "Vocational" K/S Areas based on the HP's chosen profession, and a number of additional Bonus Areas that are selected by the player. Information regarding STEEP is found on page 70. For details of the "universal" K/S Areas and their starting STEEP, go to page 96.</div>

<div>7. Choose the K/S Sub-Areas.</div>
<div>Certain K/S Areas will have a number of Sub-Areas available. Depending on the HP's STEEP in the K/S Area, you may select one or more of these, and determine the STEEP of each. Information on Sub-Areas is found on pages 108-109.</div>

<div>8. Determine the remaining general information.</div>
<div>The player can then either arbitrarily assign or randomly generate information of general nature for the HP. This information deals with the Attractiveness, Joss (something similar to luck), and detail the Background associated with the persona.</div>

<div>9. Calculate the Resources.</div>
<div>At this point the player, noting any benefits from Birth Rank (step 3, above), must roll randomly as directed by the HP's Family and Vocation SEC to determine the HP's Resources: Wealth and Net Worth, some possessions, and Special Connections that the persona may have. Logic (and the JM) will decide if Family or Vocation SEC, or some blend of the two, prevails in this regard. Information on HP Resources begins on page 112. Special Connections information is found on pages 115 &amp; 116.</div>

<div>--</div>
<div>Note: Full Practitioners (Mages [having Dweomercraeft/Magick K/S Areas] and Priests [having Priestcraeft/Religion K/S Areas] only) and Partial Practitioner Heka use is explained on pages 70, 78, and 85.</div>
<div>Heka available to Practitioner HPs is explained beginning on page 276. This is also where the table for Heka Generating K/S Areas is found.</div>
